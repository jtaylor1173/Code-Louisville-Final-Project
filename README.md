About the website:

I built this website because CADx is something I am interested in pursuing with Code Louisville.  I have over 20 years experience as 
a technologist and as a physician assistant in medical imaging.  And I want to be apart of this new developing technology to train computers
to help radiologists to provide more accurate interpretations.
